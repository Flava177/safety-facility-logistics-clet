/**
 * A fuel card CLET issued — SRS-SFL-S168fuel-04.
 *
 * <p>Until this existed, {@code FuelTransaction.maskedCardReference} was a string with nothing behind
 * it: the platform could tell you which card was used and could answer no useful question about it.
 * Anti-fraud control is the stated purpose of S168_fuel in the C9 mapping, and the commonest fuel fraud
 * is a card assigned to one vehicle being used to fill another — which is undetectable without a row
 * saying which vehicle the card belongs to.
 *
 * <p><strong>The full card number is never held.</strong> {@link #maskedReference} is the same masked
 * form the provider already sends on every transaction. It is enough to match a transaction to a card
 * and not enough to use one, and the card platform stays outside SFL where the mapping puts it.
 *
 * <p><strong>Limits are nullable and mean "the site policy decides".</strong> A card that overrides its
 * site's ceiling should have done so deliberately; a card with no opinion should follow the policy
 * rather than carry a copy of it that drifts when the policy changes.
