/**
 * Turns a signed-in actor into the set of driver records they may see.
 *
 * <h2>The join this replaces</h2>
 *
 * <p>Three places in this service asked "is this record the actor's own?" by comparing a driver's
 * {@code staffReference} against {@code ActorContext.actorId()}. That holds under header
 * authentication, where the caller supplies {@code X-SFL-User} and it happens to be the staff
 * reference. It cannot hold under a token, where {@code actorId()} is the subject claim — a Keycloak
 * UUID. So from the day authentication was switched on, the comparison was false for every driver:
 * the narrowing refused drivers their own records and, because the collection query had no narrowing
 * at all, still showed them everybody's.
 *
 * <p>The join is now an explicit column, {@code driver_profile_references.principal_subject}, resolved
 * here once per request.
 *
 * <h2>Who gets narrowed</h2>
 *
 * <p>Derived from the permission, not from a list of role names: an actor is narrowed when they hold
 * no supervising permission for the thing being read. {@code FLEET_TRIP_MANAGE} is the supervising
 * permission for trips, {@code FUEL_TRANSACTION_MANAGE} for fuel. A hard-coded list of "supervisor
 * roles" would have to be found and edited every time the matrix gains a role — and the failure mode
 * of forgetting is that a new supervisory role silently sees only their own records, or worse, that a
 * new limited role silently sees everything.
 *
 * <p>Note the direction of the default: an actor holding the supervising permission is
 * {@link DriverScope.Everything}, and everyone else who is not bound to a driver profile is
 * {@link DriverScope.Nothing} — not "unnarrowed".
