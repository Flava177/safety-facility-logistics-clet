/**
 * Builds a {@link JwtDecoder} whose JWKS fetch (and, on first use, its OIDC-discovery lookup of the
 * {@code jwks_uri}) is bounded by an explicit connect and read timeout, shared across facilities,
 * fleet-logistics and safety-security so all three fail the same way under a slow or unreachable
 * identity provider.
 *
 * <p>Spring Boot's own auto-configuration (activated when only
 * {@code spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri} is set) builds the equivalent decoder
 * with a default {@code RestTemplate} that has no connect or read timeout. Discovery and the JWKS fetch
 * both happen lazily, on the first token this instance validates - not at startup - so an unreachable or
 * stalled identity provider is invisible until then. With no read timeout, that first validation (and
 * every request thread behind it, once traffic ramps up) can block indefinitely, which is a direct path
 * to exhausting the web server's request-thread pool off one slow dependency.
 *
 * <p><strong>Chosen behaviour: lazy discovery, bounded wait, fail per-request.</strong> This still does
 * not warm the JWKS cache at startup - each service's readiness probe (`/actuator/health`) does not
 * depend on the identity provider being reachable, matching how these services are deployed today (a
 * service that cannot start because Zitadel is briefly unavailable is a worse outage than one that
 * starts and returns 401s until the identity provider recovers). What changes is that a stalled fetch now
 * fails within {@code connectTimeout + readTimeout} instead of hanging forever: a request thread that
 * would have blocked indefinitely instead fails fast with a 401, freeing the thread and the connection it
 * held. If eager startup warming is wanted for a given deployment, that is a separate, explicit decision
 * - not something this class makes on a service's behalf.
