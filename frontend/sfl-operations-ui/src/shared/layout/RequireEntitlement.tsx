 *
 * **The refusal names the grain that actually failed**, because the two are different conversations.
 * A driver reaching courier and dispatch is inside their own programme and lacks one system of it, so
 * "Fleet, Transport & Logistics is not part of your work" would be false - they are looking at it. A
 * security officer reaching the fleet register is outside their programme entirely. Same page,
 * different sentence, and only one of them is true in each case.
 *
 * **This is not the enforcement point and must never be treated as one.** Every service authorises
 * every call independently: S174 refuses an unentitled actor with `EMERGENCY_UNAUTHORIZED_SCOPE`
 * whether or not this component exists. What this does is answer the question honestly and in one
 * place, instead of leaving the operator to infer it from a broken screen.
