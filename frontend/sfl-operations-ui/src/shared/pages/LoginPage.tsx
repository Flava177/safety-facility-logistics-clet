 *
 * <h2>Why this is built on the dashboard's own kit</h2>
 *
 * The component this page was specified from is a shadcn block, and it is not used verbatim for two
 * concrete reasons rather than taste.
 *
 * Its classes are shadcn's CSS-variable tokens — `bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`,
 * `border-input`, `ring-ring`. **This project defines none of them.** Its Tailwind theme is a bespoke
 * scale, so pasting the block would have produced an unstyled form: transparent surfaces, invisible
 * borders, default type. And it ships its own `Button`, `Input`, `Label` and `cn`, all four of which
 * already exist in `shared/components/`.
 *
 * <h2>One error message for a wrong email and a wrong password</h2>
 *
 * An earlier version told them apart — "no account for that address" versus "that password is not
 * right" — on the grounds that this is a development sign-in whose whole account list is printed on
 * the page, so there was nothing to protect. The owner asked for the single message, and that is the
 * right default to build in: the moment this page points at real accounts, distinguishing the two
 * turns the form into an account-enumeration oracle. The list below still tells a developer which
 * addresses exist, which is where that information belongs.
