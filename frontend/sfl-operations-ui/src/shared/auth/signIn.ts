/**
 * Signing in against the seeded accounts.
 *
 * <h2>What happens, in order</h2>
 *
 * The email is matched against `accounts.ts`, the password against one shared constant, and on a
 * match the account becomes the actor for this browser session — username, display name, roles and
 * site scopes. Those four are what the API client sends as `X-SFL-*` on every request, so the portal
 * that opens next is the one that account's roles entitle it to.
 *
 * <h2>The failure cases are separated on purpose</h2>
 *
 * An unknown email and a wrong password are told apart here and reported the same way, which is a
 * deliberate inversion of the usual advice. Normally a sign-in form says "those details did not
 * match" for both, so an attacker cannot enumerate accounts. That reasoning does not apply to a form
 * whose entire account list is printed on the page beneath it — and pretending otherwise would cost a
 * developer the one piece of information they need, which is whether they typed the address wrong or
 * the password wrong.
 *
 * <h2>Why there is no token</h2>
 *
 * See `accounts.ts`. This is a development sign-in against services running with
 * `SFL_SECURITY_ENABLED=false`, where the actor is whatever the headers claim. `keycloak.ts` is the
 * path that issues a real token, and both write the same session shape so nothing downstream cares
 * which one was used.
