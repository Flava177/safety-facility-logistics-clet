/**
 * How this browser signs somebody in, without naming who does it.
 *
 * <h2>Why the indirection exists</h2>
 *
 * <p>Two paths have always been present: a seeded sign-in for local work against services running
 * with security off, and a token exchange against an identity provider for everything else. They
 * were reachable only by importing one file or the other, so "which one is in use" was a property of
 * whichever import somebody had written - not a decision anybody could see or change.
 *
 * <p>One environment variable decides it now, and nothing downstream knows a provider exists.
 * `session.ts` stores both kinds identically and the API client reads only the session, so the whole
 * of the dashboard is already provider-blind; this is the last place that was not.
 *
 * <h2>Naming no vendor, on purpose</h2>
 *
 * <p>The OIDC path is configured by issuer URL and client id and mentions no product anywhere in the
 * code path. Swapping the provider is then a change to `VITE_SFL_IAM_ISSUER` and the realm seed under
 * `deploy/idp/`, not a change to the application - which is the difference between a migration and a
 * refactor when that day comes.
