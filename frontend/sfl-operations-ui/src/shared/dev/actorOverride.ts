/**
 * A development-only actor override, held in session storage.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * The dashboard sends its actor as `X-SFL-*` headers taken from build-time `VITE_SFL_*` variables, so
 * changing role meant editing `.env` and restarting Vite. The pages this dashboard replaces each
 * carried an actor box on the page, which made that a five-second job.
 *
 * That barely mattered while every user saw the same navigation. It matters now: ADR 0005 made the
 * sidebar and the route guard depend on the actor's roles, so "does a driver see CCTV?" and "does a
 * facilities manager see fleet?" are questions somebody needs to be able to answer repeatedly. ADR
 * 0006 made this a precondition of retiring those pages, rather than a convenience to add later.
 *
 * ## Why session storage, and why a reload
 *
 * Session storage, so it dies with the tab. An override that survived a browser restart would
 * eventually be forgotten and mistaken for the real default.
 *
 * Applying it **reloads the page**, because programme entitlement, the navigation sections and the
 * site list are all module-level constants computed once at import. Making them reactive would mean
 * threading the actor through `programmeModel`, `programmes` and `navigation`, and a half-updated
 * entitlement is precisely the state in which a role check stops being worth running. A reload
 * recomputes everything from one source, which is also what signing in as somebody else really does.
 *
 * ## What ships
 *
 * {@link devToolsEnabled} is `import.meta.env.DEV`, which the bundler replaces with a literal. The
 * switcher panel is referenced only behind that literal, so a production build drops it. These few
 * resolver lines may survive as unreachable code; they read session storage and nothing else.
 *
 * **This was never a security boundary and this does not make it one.** The services authorise every
 * call from the headers they receive; typing a role here changes what this dashboard *asks for*, not
 * what it is allowed to have. In production the actor comes from the OIDC principal and these
 * headers are ignored entirely.
